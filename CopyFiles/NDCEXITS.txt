Reference NDC+ Release 6.01 Using NDC+ Exits (Understanding VCCONT)
       
Given -
	NDCEXITS.CPP (Contains all Stub functions for most possible exits)

	CREATE a directory and copy file into it.

	MISCONT (All Updated to use NDCEXITS as the DLL).
	STCONT
	SUPCTR
	VCCONT

Create NDCEXITS project :-

1. Create Using Microsoft Visual Studio C++ a New MSDEV Project called NDCEXITS of type (WIN32 Dynamic Link Library)

2. Add NDCEXITS.CPP to workspace

3. Add <NTGLOBAL>\TEST\INCLUDE directory to project settings

	Project Settings-> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Additional Include Directories

4. Add Library Files To Project :-

	<NTGLOBAL>\TEST\LIB\NDCCUST.LIB (Display Screen etc.)
	<NTGLOBAL>\TEST\LIB\NDCDATA.LIB (Customisation Data (GetInteger, PutInteger)
	<NTGLOBAL>\TEST\LIB\MSGUTILS.LIB (SendUnformattedMessage)
	<NTGLOBAL>\TEST\LIB\EXUTIL.LIB

5. Change Project Settings C/C++ Code Generation:-
 	Multithreaded DLL, 
	Struct Member Alignment 1 Byte

6. Remove _DEBUG from C/C++ Preprocessor

7. Build DLL and copy to <NTGLOBAL>\TEST\DLL

8. Update VCCONT to load new DLL and run InboundMessageIntercept and OutboundMessageIntercept functions when NDC Message Sender or NDC Message Receiver called :-
     
 0 (Inbound) NDCEXITS <Group Separator (ALT-29)> InboundMessageIntercept <Field Separator (ALT-28) 1 (Outbound) NDCEXITS <Group Separator (ALT-29)> OutboundMessageIntercept <Field Separator (ALT-28)

Should look like :-

	0NDCEXITS?InboundMessageIntercept?1NDCEXITS?OutboundMessageIntercept??

9. Create a new Application To Test Inbound and Outbound Messages.

	- Open Customisation Layer Project

	- Create New Catalog

	- Create New Application

	- Add Top Worker (Director)

	- Add 'NDC Customisation Data Initialiser' to start WG.
		This looks at the Exit files (VCCONT, STCONT etc. and initailises
		all exit routines - the Start of Day Hook will also be called 
                if the correct file is set-up with the exit routine).

	- Add Workgroup for NDC Message Sender (Tie Up Signal from Start WG)

		- Add NDC Message Sender Worker
			Add S4 Comms Connection (Attribute "TPA CONNECTION").
			Add String Store initialised to "HELLO NDC EXIT"

	- Add Workgroup to tie up NDC Message Sender Signals.

10.  Run Simulator

11.  Run Application - check output in C:\EXIT.LOG


		
*********************

Exiting from the Workflow....

What we are trying to do is exit from and FDK Selection State...
 
[071] [Y] 8 FDK Selection
      Screen Number           [114]
      Timeout Next State No   [473]
      Cancel Next State No    [445]
      FDK Next State No       [072] <--- Pressed an FDK Goto 072
      Extension State No      [255]
      Buffer Position         [000]
      FDK Active Mask         [127]
      Multi Language Screens  [000]
 
[072] [W] FDK Switch
      FDK 'A' Next State No   [203]
      FDK 'B' Next State No   [204]
      FDK 'C' Next State No   [205]
      FDK 'D' Next State No   [206]
      FDK 'F' Next State No   [207]
      FDK 'G' Next State No   [208]
      FDK 'H' Next State No   [209] <---- Pressed FDK 'H' Next State 209
      FDK 'I' Next State No   [000]
 
We dont want to execute the next state...we will use an 'Exit Condition Worker' 
so that this state is not executed.

So instead of doing this...we will do a Barcode Transaction and then offer another transaction (071).

      Send PIN Buffer         [001]
      Send General Buff (or X)[003]

We will skip the last two states and then return to 071... and offer more transactions.

---- Barcode Example

1. Add Exit Condition Worker to NDC Processing State Executor (Attribute 209)

2. Add New WG - tie up signal - Add Director

3. To Director Copy Active Script Host from 'Barcode Example' (Active X Sample Appliucation)

4. Replace Barcode Control and change Display Attribute to 640x480

5. Set Next State Number based on outcome

	Good - Another FDK Selection (71)
	Bad - Close State (209)

	(use Assigner to set Next State Number (found in CDI - Transaction Processing Flags)

6. Tie up signals to pass-thru and return to NDC Processing State Executor.

7. Change Clear Screen On Exit Attribute to True on NDC Processing to get rid of Blue Screen so that
   the Barcode Control is made visible (have to do this if you want to display any SSDS display workers).

---

Web Site :-

Need Local HTML Files (ONE.HTML and TWO.HTML)

0. Change Clear Screen On Exit to TRUE for Close State Executor in Card Read.

1. Add FDK (Pos 17) to Idle Loop

2. Tie signal to new workgroup with Director containing Active X Script Host

	Add Control 'Microsoft Web Control'

	Set up attribute and edit 'activate' script 		"myWEB.Navigate2("file://wherever\one.html")

	Share FDK with Host and tie signal back to Idle

----

Update CDT Build

Do all other workshops

Add Updated Files to MOREDLLS (VCCONT & NDCEXITS.DLL)

Build Final of CL (Should pick up new files)

Do CDT Build (Export of New Application).

*** Educate attendees in the rules for enhancing – what we want them to change, and not change


* Session Request / Release - MUST BE FOLLOWED!!!!!!!!

	* Exiting from State Flow - Must be aware that the time you are in your authored work the SST cannot be brought Out of Service


* Make sure the Next State Number is a valid state number (know your State Flow) otherwise Close State Will be taken.
